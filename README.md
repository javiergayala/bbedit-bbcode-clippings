### README for bbedit-bbcode-clippings

This is my first stab at writing some Clippings for BBEdit.  They provide clippings for the majority of BBCode tags.

If you select a clipping with _(Selection)_ in the name, it will put whatever selection you have highlighted inside of the tags.

Any and all feedback is welcome!
